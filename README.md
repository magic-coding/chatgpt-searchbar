Welcome to the **ChatGPT Searchbar** extension! This nifty little Chrome extension adds a search input to the chat interface of the ChatGPT website, making it easier to find specific conversations. No more endless scrolling! 🚀

## 🤔 Why did I build this extension?

As much as we all love ChatGPT, searching for a specific conversation in the interface could be a daunting task. With no built-in search functionality, finding the right conversation often turned into a time-consuming scavenger hunt. So, I decided to create this simple yet effective searchbar extension to improve the user experience and make life a little bit easier for everyone. 😄

## 📥 How to download and install

To download and install the ChatGPT Searchbar extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension source code from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/malnafei/chatgpt-searchbar). You can either clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder.

2. Open the Extension Management page in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions/`. Alternatively, click the Chrome menu (the three vertical dots in the top-right corner), then More Tools > Extensions.

3. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner.

4. Load the unpacked extension by clicking the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension source code and select it.

Voilà! The extension is now installed in your Chrome browser, and you can start searching through your ChatGPT conversations with ease. 🎯
